  <p>Change, especially technical, can be a scary prospect for the staff of any organization. Customers are motivated to adopt new technical skills when they learn to integrate them into their current planning and processes. My approach to new
    projects reflects my missions:

    <ul>
      <li>being passionate about putting the "human (H)" back into technology</li>
      <li>let the customer be great </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Professional skills that I bring include:</p>
